# What is API Testing?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk
to each other.

# The Purpose of API Testing

The purpose of API Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces.

In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs(keyboard) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system's response.

# Where is API Testing Performed?

API testing is performed at the most critical layer: business, in which business logic processing is carried out and all transactions between the user interface and database layers happen.gi
